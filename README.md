This will be for Support ticket system a little neat helper that will forward email directly too API instead of
polling email 10 minutes this tool fix it instantly.

In future it should work with OsTicket and Katak

Unfortantly we are still in testing mode and the code for now is really messed up.

Notice do not run or use unless you know how to write code in C# because you will most probobly need it, this code is incomplete, and will over time most probobly change a lot.
